- **the objective of Ranking Losses is to predict relative distances between inputs**.
	- This task if often called **metric learning**.
- How to use ranking losses?
	- our model needs to output a similarity score between two datapoints
		- this score can be binary (similar / dissimilar)
		- we only care about the similarity score (distance), the absolute value isn't needed
	- two main setups:
		- When we use **pairs of training data** points OR
		- **triplets of training data** points.
- **Pairwise ranking loss**
	- $$L = \begin{cases} d(r_a,r_p) & \text{if Positive Pair} \\ \max(0,m - d(r_a,r_n)) & \text{if Negative Pair} \end{cases}$$

- **Triplet Ranking Loss**
	- This works better than pairwise ranking loss:
		- **The objective is that the distance between the anchor sample and the negative sample representations $d(r_a, r_n)$ is greater (and bigger than a margin m) than the distance between the anchor and positive representations $d(r_a, r_p)$**.
