https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score
There are several versions of F-score:
**F1 score:**

$$F_1 = 2\frac{\text{precision} \cdot \text{recall}}{\text{precision}+\text{recall}}$$
$F_\beta$ **Score**
- Used when recall is considered $\beta$ times as important as precision
$$F_\beta = (1+\beta^2)\frac{\text{precision} \cdot \text{recall}}{(\beta^2 \cdot \text{precision})+\text{recall}}$$
