- In supervised graph classification, the task is to solve an end-to-end whole-graph classification problem (i.e. the problem of as-signing a label to the entire graph).
	- hese supervised approaches [ 33 , 36, 45 , 61 ] learn an intermediate representation of an entire graph as a precondition in order to solve the classification task.
- but is heavily biased towards maximizing performance on the classification task of interest.
