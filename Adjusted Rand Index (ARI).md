- ARI is a measure of distances between different sample splits
- The rand index
    - evaluates a share of observations for which these splits (initial and clustering result) are consistent
    - evaluates the similarity of the two splits of the same sample
    - $$RI = \frac{2(a + b)}{n(n - 1)}$$
    - n = # observations in sample
    - a = the number of observation pairs with the same labels and located in the same cluster
    - b = the number of observations with different labels and located in different clusters

- We should scale the rand index for the number to be close to 0
    - $$ARI = \frac{RI - E[RI]}{max(RI) - E[RI]}$$
- This metric is between [-1, 1]
    - -1 means independence of splits (I think that the splits don't line up with the real splits)
    - 1 means the splits are consistent
    - metric is also symmetric
