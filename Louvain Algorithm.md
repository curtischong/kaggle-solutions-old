    - The actual implementation of the algorithm is found here
- This algorithm finds communities (aka subgraphs)
- it merges communities together until there is 1 community
    - A bit like the second half of [[brown clustering]]
- It determines which nodes to merge into a cluster via the delta in a metric called Modularity
- you get delta modularity by removing and inserting each node into a different community until there is no significant increase in modularity
- I think modularity is metric for the entire graph, not individual nodes
    - The faster metric that is used in the algo is an approximation (I think) called delta Mm
