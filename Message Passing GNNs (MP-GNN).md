	- they are graph neural networks but you are aggregating the features from nearby nodes. that's it!
- How are graph neural networks different from [[Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)]]

- main problems:
	- Since MPNNs are limited by problems of over-smoothing, over-squashing, and low expressivity against the WL test [1, 54], these layers could irreparably fail to keep some information in the early stage
