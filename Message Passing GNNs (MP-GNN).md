	- they are graph neural networks but you are aggregating the features from nearby nodes. that's it!
- How are MP-GNNs different from [[Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)]]
	- People refer to them as the same things.
		- This article does say that the difference is: message passing is a way to approximate graph convolutions.
			- Message passing is like taking into account the one-hop embeddings of your neighbouring nodes.
				- This is what one layer does in a GN
- main problems:
	- Since MPNNs are limited by problems of over-smoothing, over-squashing, and low expressivity against the WL test [1, 54], these layers could irreparably fail to keep some information in the early stage
