- each leaf starts as a cluster, we just merge each leaf until we have 1 cluster
- The hierarchy of clusters is represented as a tree (dendrogram)
- steps
    - 1) treat each datapoint as a single cluster
    - 2) select a distance metric
        - one distance is average linkage (aka the distance b/w the two clusters is the average distance between data points in the first cluster and the second)
    - 3) combine the two nearest clusters into 1 at each iteration
    - 4) repeat step 3 until there's 1 cluster.
- pros
    - We don't need to specify the number of clusters
        - we can select which number of clusters look best based on our tree!
    - The algorithm isn't sensitive to the choice of the distance metric
        - all distance metrics work well, other algos live or die on the distance metric
    - this also can also uncover underlying hierarchy from our data
- con:
    - time complexity is O(n^3). n merges, n^2 distance comparisons between pairs
