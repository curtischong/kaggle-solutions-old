- So the Fiedler vector ends up painting the graph in a gradient that goes from positive to negative. Each individual value 𝑥𝑖�� doesn't mean much by itself. But the relative values do: clusters of vertices that are close together get similar values, and far-apart vertices often get different values.
- For the next eigenvector, we will add an additional constraint to our problem: we'll be looking for a vector 𝐲� perpendicular to the Fiedler vector. Essentially, this says that 𝐲� should have similar properties, but be _different_ from the thing we found just now, describing a different feature of the graph.
- For example, if our graph has three big and sparsely connected clusters, the Fiedler vector might assign positive values to one cluster and negative values to the other two. The next eigenvector might choose a different cluster to separate from the other two clusters. This distinguishes all the clusters, so the eigenvector after that will have to find some inter-cluster separation...
