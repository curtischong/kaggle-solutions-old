- [[brown clustering]]
    - Is there brown clustering using BERT?
- There are graph-based clustering techniques called [[spectral clustering]]
    - Methods used include minimal spanning tree-based clustering, Markov chain clustering and Chinese whispers.

- LDA clustering
- To tell between a good vs bad Dirichlet distribution, you look at how the points cluster on each distribution
    - generally you want to keep your Dirichlet parameters below one.
- Good word and topic distributions are usually approximated by using techniques such as collapsed Gibbs sampling or expectation propagation.
