- uses only the initial unlabelled points and the final clusters
- can be used to help identify the optimal number of clusters k by taking the number of clusters that maximizes the silhouette coefficient.
- steps
    - 1) calculate the silhouette coefficient for each observation
    - a = mean of the distance between an object and other objects within one cluster
    - bÂ = the mean distance from an object to an object from the nearest cluster (different from the one the object belongs to)
- $$s = \frac{b - a}{max(a,b)}$$
- The silhouette of a sample is a mean value of silhouette values from this sample
    - Therefore, the silhouette distance shows to which extent the distance between the objects of the same class differ from the mean distance between the objects from different clusters.
- properties
    - values in the [-1, 1] range
    - -1 corresponds to bad clustering results
    - 1 correspond to dense, well-defined clusters
