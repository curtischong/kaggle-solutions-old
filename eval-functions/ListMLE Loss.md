- Listwise Maximum Likelihood Estimation.
- Use for [[learning to rank]]:
	- $$ListMLELoss = -\sum y_i * \log(\text{softmax}(\hat{y_i}))$$
	- `yi`Â is typically the ground truth relevance score or label of the i-th item in the list.
	- note that softmax($\hat{y_i}$) is the model's guess of the probability of the score for the ith item
- the loss is minimized when we maximize the probability of the observed ranking.
