##### Summary
- Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts in the chemical reactions of living organisms.
- Novozymes finds enzymes in nature and optimizes them for use in industry.
##### Solutions

	- "there was a big shakeup, so this isn't the best solution"
	- Nodes represent residues, and if two residues are closer than a certain distance, the nodes are connected by edges.
	- The features of each node are the embedding vectors of wildtype sequence and mutant sequence generated by HuggingFace'sÂ `facebook/esm2_t33_650M_UR50D`
