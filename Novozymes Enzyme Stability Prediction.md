**Problem Type:** 
**Input:** 
**Output:** the predicted rank thermal stability of enzyme variants
- officially, you want to output n tuples (seq_id, tm) - tm is the melting temperature of the enzyme
	- Higher **`tm`** means the protein variant is more stable.
- Since only the Spearman Correlation Coefficient will be used for the evaluation, **the correct prediction of the relative order is more important than the absolute tm values**.
	- Basically, **the tm value that you predict is just used to order your predictions** (before running spearman's correlation coefficient with the t_true)

**Eval Metric:** [[Spearman's correlation Coefficient]]
##### Summary
- Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts in the chemical reactions of living organisms.
- Novozymes finds enzymes in nature and optimizes them for use in industry.
##### Solutions
- (1st) Protein as a Graph
	- https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/novozymes-enzyme-stability-prediction/discussion/376371
	- "there was a big shakeup, so this isn't the best solution"
	- Nodes represent residues, and if two residues are closer than a certain distance, the nodes are connected by edges.
	- The features of each node are the embedding vectors of wildtype sequence and mutant sequence generated by HuggingFace's `facebook/esm2_t33_650M_UR50D`

##### Important notebooks/discussions
- EDA and explaining what this competition is
	- https://www.kaggle.com/code/dschettler8845/novo-esp-eda-baseline
	- The frequency of some amino acids respective to the length of the AA sequence has a low, but non-zero correlation with the target tm�� (melting point)
    - The fractional frequency appears slightly more informative
	- Some amino acid sequences are REALLY long... especially considering all of our test AA sequences are relatively short ~240 vs more than 32,000
	- While some amino acids are more common than others, all are relatively common (Sequences on average contain 1.5% to 10% of each amino acid respectively).
	- ph is from **0.0-11.0**
	- there is a negative tm (target) value. why?
