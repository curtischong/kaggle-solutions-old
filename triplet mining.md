- The goal of the triplet loss is to make sure that:
	- 1) Two examples with the same label have their embeddings close together in the embedding space
	- 2) Two examples with different labels have their embeddings far away.
- To formalise this requirement, the loss will be defined over **triplets** of embeddings:
	- an **anchor**
	- a **positive** of the same class as the anchor
	- a **negative** of a different class
- For some distance on the embedding space d, the loss of a triplet (a,p,n) is:
	- $L=\max(d(a,p)−d(a,n)+\text{margin},0)$
	- where margin is a value we choose that says: "the negative should be farther away than the positive by this margin"
	- This loss pushes:
		- d(anchor, pos) to 0
		- d(anchor, neg) to be greater than d(anchor, pos) + margin
- hard negatives are examples that are closer to the anchor example than the positive example:

- **online mining:** we have computed a batch of B embeddings from a batch of B inputs. Now we want to generate triplets from these B embeddings.
