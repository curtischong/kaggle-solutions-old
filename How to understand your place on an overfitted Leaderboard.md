- you can tell that the public LB is overfitted if:
	- you have a good local CV, and you're doing a lot, but still not doing that well on the leaderboard
	- there are too many beginners on the top ranks
- You can get an accurate understanding of where you are by
	- 1) Pulling the scores of masters & grandmasters with low scores (with prob > 5 submissions)
		- cause these ppl typically submit decent submissions (and have good CV)
	- 2) Then plot these scores on the scatter plot
		- Try to beat these scores in your local CV
		- Note: your local CV should have a worse score than the public leaderboard since submissions are trained on all the data (not just n - 1 folds in CV)
