- eigenvalues of a [[Laplacian]] matrix
- the number of non-zero eigenvalues corresponds to the number of components in the graph
    - there will always be 1 zero eigenvalue since the graph must contain at minimum 1 component
- The first nonzero eigenvalue is called the spectral gap.
    - The spectral gap gives us some notion of the density of the graph.
    - If this graph was densely connected (all pairs of the 10 nodes had an edge), then the spectral gap would be 10.
- The second eigenvalue is called the Fiedler value, and the corresponding vector is the Fiedler vector.
    - The Fiedler value approximates the minimum graph cut needed to separate the graph into two connected components
    - if our graph is already two connected components the Fiedler value is 0
    - if the entry of a node into the Fiedler vector gives us a value > 0, then they belong to one class whereas nodes that gives us a value < 0 gives us another class
- this Fiedler value works since eigenvalues near 0 tells us that there is almost a separation of two components
    - this makes the bridge that connects the components will have a small eigen value
    - the vector associated with the bridge's eigenvalue tells us how to separate the nodes into those approximately connected components.
- all you need to do is kmeans on the eigenvalues to cluster the graph!

- if there is no graph to our data, we can create a graph using a k nearest neighbours to create the graph.
    - This assumes that the points that are close to each other are in the same cluster
- An even better approach is to create an affinity matrix
    - this is a matrix that is just like an adjacency matrix, but the value of each pair of points expresses how similar those points are to each other.
- affinity is like the weights for our graph
