- Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
- Works on the same principle as [[mean-shift clustering]]
- steps
    - 1) start with a node that hasn't been visited
    - 2) if this point has sufficient amount of neighbours, the clustering process starts
        - A neighbour is defined as within epsilon away
        - if there are insufficient points, the datapoint is labelled as noise
        - both cases mark the point as visited
    - 3) the points within epsilon away are part of the same cluster
    - 4) then repeat the steps 2&3 to find all of the points of this cluster
        - we are done when all points within the epsilon neighbourhood has been visited
    - 5) once we're done with the current cluster, a new unvisited point is retrieved and processed
- pros
    - it doesn't require a pe-set number of clusters at all
    - it identifies outliers as noise
    - it can find arbitrarily shaped clusters quite well
- cons
    - it doesn't perform as well when the clusters are of varying density
        - cause the epsilon and minPoints requirement will differ from cluster to cluster
    - it's hard to determine epsilon for high-dimensional data since it's difficult to estimate
