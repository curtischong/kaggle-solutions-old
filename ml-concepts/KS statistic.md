- can be used to test whether a [sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample "Random sample") came from a given reference probability distribution (one-sample K–S test), or to test whether two samples came from the same distribution (two-sample K–S test)
	- this is a non-parametric test. so it **makes minimal assumptions about the underlying distribution**
