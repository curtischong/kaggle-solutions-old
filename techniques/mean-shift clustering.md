- goal: find dense area of points
- steps
- 1) start your sliding window (aka a sphere) at some point
- 2) then keep moving the centre of your window to the mean of the datapoints
- 3) keep doing this until it's stopped
- 4) Do this multiple times to find all the clusters
- 5) remove all of the duplicate spheres (at the same point/near each other) at the end of the algo

- pros:
    - you don't have to select the number of clusters
- con:
    - selecting the right radius is hard
