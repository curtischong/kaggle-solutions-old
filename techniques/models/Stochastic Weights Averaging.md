-  Saves the best n epochs states and then averages them in final model.
- implementation: https://github.com/btbpanda/CAFA5-protein-function-prediction-2nd-place/blob/main/protnn/swa.py#L8
	- you can either do a simple average, or a weighted average
	- the weighted average is based on the score you pass into the function
		- `w = score / sum(self.scores[:n]) if weighted else 1 / n`
		- where the self.scores is appended to when you call `add_checkpoint(self, model, score=1, ):`
