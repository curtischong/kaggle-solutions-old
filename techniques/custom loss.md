- this tag is here so we can easily find custom losses for different types of problems
- When making your own custom loss, just make sure that it's continuous
	- so gradient descent can minimize it iteratively
	- HOWEVER, some models (like random forests), they don't need to be smooth
		- since they evaluate the quality of a split (e.g. gini index)
