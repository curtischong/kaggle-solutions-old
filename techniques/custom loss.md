- this tag is here so we can easily find custom losses for different types of problems
- When making your own custom loss, just make sure that it's continuous
	- so gradient descent can minimize it iteratively
	- HOWEVER, some models (like random forests), they don't need to be smooth
		- since they evaluate the quality of a split (e.g. gini index)
- How to improve your loss
	- if your loss has the form: $\sum \frac{t}{r}$, consider using $\sum \frac{t^2}{r^2}$
		- play with how this looks:

		- the distribution of the loss looks like an inverse bell graph
			- there are more values with smaller loss, and more with larger loss
