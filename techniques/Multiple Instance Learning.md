A form of supervised learning
- The training instances are arranged in sets of instances, known as bags
	- the label is assigned to the entire bag instead of the individual instances in the bag.
	- Use this when it is difficult to provide labels for every single instance.
		- e.g. classifying the type of cancer given medical images
		- e.g. Classifying a text document (the class is on the whole doc, not individual sentences)
