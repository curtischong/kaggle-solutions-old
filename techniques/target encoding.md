Goal: replace a categorical column with a numeric column (like [[one-hot encoding]])

Use one column (like [[frequency encoding]]). Except instead of replacing the category with the frequency it appears, we replace it with the mean of the target that appears

Variations:
- replace it with the standard deviation of the target that appears
