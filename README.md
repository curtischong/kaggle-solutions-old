The goal: to identify ALL the techniques used by the best teams
Why? Knowing these tips helps you build intuition on what to do. It makes you better

I am using this site to gather the solutions: https://farid.one/kaggle-solutions/
I will be filling out this repo in reverse chronological order (since newer techniques are more important)

Why study Kaggle competitions?
- Cause people have to go through the entire ml process
- People need to be considerate of computational resources
- Many people iterate on the same problem -> better ideas
- It's a competition, so people try a lot harder to figure out what works/doesn't
- They aren't motivated to only show positive results. People will talk about their failures as well

Why use this resource:
- I looked at each competition holistically, scouring discussions as if I were actually competing
- I verify nuances by looking at the specific implementations written on their github / jupyter solutions

In general:
- things that work for some teams (models / features) may not work for every team
- but some features / techniques always works on a problem
- pretrained neural net embeddings are OP. just use them, even with small datasets
- hyperparam tuning won't save you. garbage features => bad predictions
- winning teams try things that aren't done in the public notebooks.
- trust your CV, not your ego. Don't get attached to implementations that *should* work
