The goal: to identify ALL the techniques used by the best teams
Why? Knowing these tips helps you build intuition on what to do. It makes you better

I am using this site to gather the solutions: https://farid.one/kaggle-solutions/
I will be filling out this repo in reverse chronological order (since newer techniques are more important)

https://www.kaggle.com/code/sudalairajkumar/winning-solutions-of-kaggle-competitions
- this is good cuase they have tags on the types of competitions

Why study Kaggle competitions?
- Cause people have to go through the entire ml process
- People need to be considerate of computational resources
- Many people iterate on the same problem -> better ideas
- It's a competition, so people try a lot harder to figure out what works/doesn't
- They aren't motivated to only show positive results. People will talk about their failures as well
- People will post their code. So if there's something confusing, you can read the implementation to fully understand it
- Kaggle writeups are simpler to read than papers.
- Writeups will self-select important topics for you to learn more about, especially if you see it between competitions

Why use this resource:
- I looked at each competition holistically, scouring discussions as if I were actually competing
- I verify nuances by looking at the specific implementations written on their github / jupyter solutions

In general:
- things that work for some teams (models / features) may not work for every team
- but some features / techniques always works on a problem
- pretrained neural net embeddings are OP. just use them, even with small datasets
- hyperparam tuning won't save you. garbage features => bad predictions
- winning teams try things that aren't done in the public notebooks.
- trust your CV, not your ego. Don't get attached to implementations that *should* work

How to review kaggle problems efficiently
1) read the intro
2) sort all of the notebooks by most votes (not hottest). this will usually give you an indication of what to do / what the competition is
3) fill in the objective / input / output fields in the competition template
4) write down what you learn in the notebook in the popular notebooks
5) see more notebooks (before the competition end - to figure out what ppl were saying during the competition), or top solutions

If you want to search for winnin solutions using a technique, search for:
"kaggle 2nd place solution conditional probability"
- and iterate the "2nd"
